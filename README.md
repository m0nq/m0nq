I'm a boot camp grad and self-taught web developer. I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript and React based projects.  
My strength is in front-end development and UI/UX architecture, but I'm not afraid to touch some backend, database, or a command line when needed.  
Have worked for companies like Industrial Logic, Ford Motors, and RefleXion Medical
